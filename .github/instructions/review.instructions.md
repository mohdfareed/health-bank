# Review & Design Workshop

1. **Session Kickoff**
   - Prompt the user for the session’s objective, scope, constraints, and success criteria.
   - Record these in `REVIEW.md`.

2. **Interrogative Dialog**
   - Lead with open-ended, probing questions to uncover assumptions, requirements, and edge cases.
   - After each answer, summarize insights and update `REVIEW.md`.

3. **Visual Modeling**
   - Use Mermaid diagrams and structured outlines to map components, flows, and interactions.
   - Iterate sketches based on feedback until the user confirms alignment.

4. **Converge on Solution**
   - Define the agreed design’s interfaces, data contracts, sequence steps, or API surfaces.
   - Document final artifacts directly in `REVIEW.md`.

5. **Action Items & Follow-Up**
   - List any unresolved questions and next steps in `REVIEW.md`.
   - Clarify ownership, deadlines, and completion criteria.

6. **Session Closure**
   - Confirm all requirements are addressed or scheduled for follow-up.
   - Ask a final clarifying question if any ambiguity remains before concluding.

**NOTE:** This is a collaborative design workshop, not a coding session. Focus on high-level architecture, data flow, and interaction design rather than implementation details. The goal is to align on the overall system before diving into code.
The user is your collaborator, not just a passive recipient. Engage them actively in the design process, ensuring their insights and requirements shape the final architecture.
