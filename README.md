# HealthVaults

HealthVaults is an iOS application that provides a flexible, insight-driven approach to health tracking. Unlike traditional calorie counting apps that reset daily budgets, HealthVaults uses **7-day running average budgeting** to provide a more realistic and sustainable approach to nutrition management.

Built with SwiftUI and integrated with Apple HealthKit, the app tracks calorie intake, weight trends, and macro-nutrients while providing intelligent budget adjustments based on weekly patterns.

## Features

- **Smart Budgeting**: 7-day EWMA smoothing for realistic calorie budgeting
- **Maintenance Estimation**: Automatic calculation of daily maintenance calories from weight trends
- **Apple Health Integration**: Seamless data sync with HealthKit
- **Widget Support**: Home screen widgets for quick budget and macro tracking
- **Macro Tracking**: Detailed protein, carbohydrate, and fat monitoring

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI with reactive `@Observable` pattern
- **Data Storage**: SwiftData (app-generated) + HealthKit (external)
- **Widgets**: WidgetKit with App Groups data sharing
- **Analytics**: Custom EWMA and linear regression algorithms

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: User entries via SwiftUI forms
2. **Storage**: SwiftData → HealthKit synchronization
3. **Analytics**: Combined data processing with EWMA smoothing
4. **Display**: Reactive UI updates and widget refresh

## Mathematical Specification

### Implementation Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| EWMA α | 0.25 | 7-day smoothing factor |
| Energy/Weight | 7700 kcal/kg | Conservative energy equivalent |
| Weight Window | 90 days | Regression period for maintenance |
| Min Valid Data | 14 days | Required for stable estimates |

### Core Algorithms

#### 1. Calorie Credit System

**EWMA Smoothing**:
$$S_t = \alpha \cdot C_{t-1} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot S_{t-1}$$

**Credit Calculation**:
$$\text{Credit}_t = B - S_t$$

**Adjusted Budget**:
$$B'_t = B + \frac{\text{Credit}_t}{D}$$

Where $D$ is days remaining in weekly cycle.

#### 2. Maintenance Estimation

**Weight Trend** (Linear regression):
$$m = \frac{\sum(i - \bar{i})(w_i - \bar{w})}{\sum(i - \bar{i})^2}$$

**Energy Imbalance**:
$$\Delta E = m \times \rho$$

**Maintenance Estimate**:
$$M = S_t - \Delta E$$

## Building

### Requirements
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+ deployment target
- Swift 5.9+

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build the project
./Scripts/build.sh -b

# Clean build
./Scripts/build.sh -c
```

### Configuration
1. Configure App Groups in Xcode for widget data sharing
2. Enable HealthKit entitlements for background delivery
3. Configure signing for both app and widget targets

## Development

### Project Structure
```
├── App/                 # Main application
├── Shared/              # Shared code
│   ├── Models/         # Data models and protocols
│   ├── Services/       # Business logic and HealthKit
│   └── Views/          # SwiftUI components
├── Widgets/            # Widget extension
└── Scripts/            # Build automation
```

### Key Patterns
- **Data Models**: Observable classes with HealthKit sync
- **Services**: Dependency injection with environment values
- **Views**: Reactive with automatic refresh on data changes
- **Analytics**: Pure value types for mathematical operations
